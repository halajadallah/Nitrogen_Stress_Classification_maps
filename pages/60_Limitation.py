1. Time to complete this project.

2. Lack of input from on the ground farmers or assistants who can provide information about type of crop, growth stage, amount of nitrogen supplied 
   to the soil and at what time, along with their field location.

3. Lack of ground field data, such as type of crop, biomass, nitrogen concentration, leaf area index, and other nitrogen related plant
   traits, along with location. 

4. Heavy clouds preclude the collection of clear satellite images during rainy seasons, in particular, the Aus season (June To August).
