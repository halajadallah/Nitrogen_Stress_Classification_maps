We compare the vegetation Index over four or five years. To make the comparison we standardize the index by computing the mean and standard deviation over the years. 

* mean =mean(ind_2019,ind_2020,ind_2021,ind_2022)

* std = std(ind_2019,ind_2020,ind_2021,ind_2022)

Standardized index = (index â€“ mean)/std

# Classification:

### we classify nitrogen content based on __number of standard deviations from the mean__.

### Poor : (-2, -1] ;  Mild Stress: (-1, 0], Normal: (0, 1] and Good: (1, 2]
