We compare the vegetation Index over four or five years. To make the comparison we standardize the index by computing the mean and standard deviation over the years. 

* mean =mean(ind_2019,ind_2020,ind_2021,ind_2022)

* std = std(ind_2019,ind_2020,ind_2021,ind_2022)

Standardized index = (index â€“ mean)/std

## Classification:

#### we classify nitrogen content based on __number of standard deviations from the mean__.

#### Poor : (-2 to -1) ;  Mild Stress: (-1 to 0), Normal: (0 to 1) and Good: (1 to 2)
